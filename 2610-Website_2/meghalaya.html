<h3>Mawlynnong Village (Shillong)</h3>
<p>The Mawlynnong Village in Meghalaya has been consecutively voted as Asia's cleanest village and is one of places the to visit in Meghalaya</p>
<p> It is hard to spot even a single piece of straw or dusty roads here. The roads seem to be freshly laid and the village stands out distinctively for housing some of the rarest natural wonders of north east, like the Mawlynnong waterfall, which is a sight to behold, pushing its way through lush vegetation and descending into clear waters below</p>
<p> The live root bridge here (Not to be confused with the Double Decker Bridge in Cherapunjee) is the major attraction for all the visitors while the boulders here supported by nothing but pint sized stones, are a mystery for archaeological travelers who come here</p>

<h3>Umiam Lake (Ri Bhoi District, Nongpoh)</h3>
<p>If you plan to visit Umiam Lake in the winter time, from October to February, you'll be dumbfounded by its beauty.</p>
<p>If you plan to visit it in the summer months of May to July, you won't believe it's the same lake. Located in Nongpoh, Meghalaya The Umiam Lake is basically made from the reservoir built due to the dam here. </p>

<h3>Mawsmai Cave (Shella Road, Cherapunjee)</h3>
<p>Mawsmai Cave in Meghalaya has a bit of a reputation among travelers. The place is eerily dark and has cramped and narrow paths entwined with each other, and to add some more thrill into the idea of a cave pitch black in broad daylight, there is just one entry and exit point. </p>
<p>Funnily enough, it might sound daunting to take your shoes off while entering the cave, but it's one advice you can follow with closed eyes. Or choose to carry and change of clothes and footwear.</p>
<p>This Cave in Meghalaya is what many explorers would call a eerie experience from the face of it, but well worth the tour anyway. </p>
